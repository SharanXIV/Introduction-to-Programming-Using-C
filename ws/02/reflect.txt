At Home Reflection

The most important thing that I have learnt from this workshop is that although something can be coded, there is always an alternate means to get the same answer. Another thing that I have learned is that casting integers into floats can be useful in calculating and printing decimal numbers more efficiently. We must add 0.005 when calculating the GST because although %.2lf will display as 1.13, the C compiler will truncate the number to 1.12 when it is multiplied by 100 and cast into an integer. Casting allows us a way to convert a variable to a data type into another data type. For example, we can cast a float into an int variable. I think we were required to use the modulus operator to show that multiple correct answers can be generate using different methods. Also, it allowed us to think about using casting between integers and floats because modulus doesn't allow it to be used with floats, only integers.
